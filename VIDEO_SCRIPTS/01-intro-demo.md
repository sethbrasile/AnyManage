**Video title:** Agent PM: AI Project Management for Non-Technical Users
**Target length:** 3-4 minutes
**Audience:** Non-technical PMs curious about AI tools
**Tone:** Conversational, Seth's voice

---

## Section 1: Hook (15 seconds)

| VISUAL | AUDIO |
|--------|-------|
| SHOW: Terminal window with command prompt | "What if you could manage clients by just... talking to your computer?" |
| SHOW: Type "Add new client Acme Corp" - AI response appears | "Like this." |

**Production notes:**
- Terminal font 18pt minimum
- Pause 1 second after typing before AI responds
- Let the response fully render before continuing

---

## Section 2: What This Is (30 seconds)

| VISUAL | AUDIO |
|--------|-------|
| SHOW: Terminal with AI prompt ready | "This is Agent PM - a system that lets you manage projects using natural language." |
| SHOW: Folders appearing in sidebar (entities/Acme Corp/) | "You tell it what to do, and it handles all the technical stuff - the files, the git commits (if you don't know what those are, perfect - you don't need to)..." |
| SHOW: Quick flash of markdown files with readable content | "...all the organization. You just work in plain English." |

**Production notes:**
- Quick cut to folder structure, don't linger
- Emphasize "you don't need to" - slight pause there
- Keep energy natural, not salesy

---

## Section 3: Quick Demo (90 seconds)

| VISUAL | AUDIO |
|--------|-------|
| SHOW: Terminal ready | "Let me show you what I mean." |
| TYPE: `Add new client Acme Corp` | "Add a client. Just type: Add new client Acme Corp." |
| SHOW: AI confirms creation with folder structure | "Done. It created the folder, set up the files, and it's ready to go." |
| PAUSE: 2 seconds | (let viewer read the response) |
| TYPE: `Add CEO is Jane Smith to Acme's profile` | "Want to add details? Just say it: Add CEO is Jane Smith to Acme's profile." |
| SHOW: AI confirms update | "It puts that in the right place automatically." |
| TYPE: `Process notes for Acme` | "Now here's where it gets useful. Say I have meeting notes..." |
| SHOW: Paste some example notes (or reference a notes file) | "...I can just tell it to process notes for Acme." |
| SHOW: AI extracts tasks, facts, calendar items | "It reads through, pulls out tasks, facts, anything that needs to go on the calendar - and puts everything in the right place." |
| PAUSE: 2 seconds | (let viewer see the categorization) |
| TYPE: `Show me Acme's status` | "And if I want to see where things stand: Show me Acme's status." |
| SHOW: Status output with profile summary and roadmap items | "Everything organized, human-readable, and I never touched a config file." |

**Production notes:**
- Each command: type at normal human speed (not slow-mo, not blazing fast)
- Pause after each AI response so viewer can read
- The notes processing is the "wow moment" - give it time
- Don't rush the status output - let it settle

## Section 4: What's Coming (30 seconds)

| VISUAL | AUDIO |
|--------|-------|
| SHOW: Title card "Coming Up in This Series" | "This is the first video in a series." |
| SHOW: Thumbnails/text: "Full Setup Walkthrough" | "Next up: a full setup walkthrough where I'll show you everything from opening terminal for the first time to running your first command." |
| SHOW: Text list: "Processing Notes", "Voice Training", "Specialists" | "After that, we'll go deeper - processing notes, voice training (so the AI writes like you, not like a robot), and specialists." |
| SHOW: Back to terminal | "Everything you need to go from zero to actually using this thing." |

**Production notes:**
- Title cards simple, not animated
- Thumbnails can be placeholder graphics for now
- Keep this section moving - it's a preview, not an overview

---

## Section 5: Where to Start (15 seconds)

| VISUAL | AUDIO |
|--------|-------|
| SHOW: GitHub repo page | "Link to the repo is in the description." |
| SHOW: Docs folder | "The docs folder has written guides if you prefer reading to watching." |
| SHOW: Terminal with AI ready | "And the next video is right here when you're ready to set it up." |
| FADE: End card with links | (brief pause, no "thanks for watching" - just end) |

**Production notes:**
- End card: repo link, next video link
- No subscribe plea - if people want to, they will
- Clean ending - don't drag it out
