## Section 1: The Feature (30 seconds)

| VISUAL | AUDIO |
|--------|-------|
| SHOW: Terminal with Claude Code | "Okay, this one's optional but it's one of my favorite features." |
| SHOW: Text overlay "AI writes like you" | "You can train AnyManage to write like you. Emails, documents, chat messages - all in your voice." |
| SHOW: Before/after comparison (generic vs personalized text) | "Instead of sounding like a robot wrote it (because one did), it sounds like you wrote it." |
| SHOW: Back to terminal | "Less editing. More authentic output. Let me show you how it works." |

**Production notes:**
- "Optional but favorite" - genuine enthusiasm without pressure
- Before/after shows value immediately
- Keep intro tight

## Section 2: Starting Training (30 seconds)

| VISUAL | AUDIO |
|--------|-------|
| SHOW: Terminal prompt | "Start with: train my voice" |
| TYPE: `Train my voice` | "Train my voice." |
| SHOW: Claude responds with prompt | "Claude asks what kind of writing you want to train. Emails? Documentation? Chat messages?" |
| SHOW: Options displayed | "Pick what you use most. You can always come back and train more types later." |
| TYPE: Select "emails" | "I'll do emails." |

**Production notes:**
- Quick interaction
- Don't over-explain the options - just pick one

---

## Section 3: Providing Samples (90 seconds)

| VISUAL | AUDIO |
|--------|-------|
| SHOW: Claude asking for samples | "Now Claude needs examples of your writing. Real stuff you've already written." |
| SHOW: Prompt for first sample | "Paste in an email you've sent. Doesn't need to be perfect - actually, imperfect is better. That's your real voice." |
| SHOW: Paste example email | "Here's one I sent last week..." |
| PAUSE: 1 second | (show the email) |
| SHOW: Claude asking for more | "It wants a few more. The more variety, the better it understands your patterns." |
| SHOW: Paste another email | "Different context this time - maybe a client update instead of an internal message." |
| SHOW: Paste third email | "And one more." |
| SHOW: Claude acknowledging enough samples | "That's enough to work with." |
| SHOW: Text overlay "Good samples = variety" | "Pro tip: mix it up. Different recipients, different situations. You probably write a bit differently to a client than to a coworker, and the AI can learn that." |

**Production notes:**
- Show actual email-ish content (redacted if needed)
- "Imperfect is better" - important insight, emphasize
- Variety tip is genuinely useful

## Section 4: The Extraction Process (45 seconds)

| VISUAL | AUDIO |
|--------|-------|
| SHOW: Claude processing | "Now Claude analyzes your samples." |
| SHOW: Text overlay listing traits | "It's looking for: sentence structure, how you open and close, your vocabulary, phrases you use a lot, even your punctuation habits." |
| SHOW: Voice profile being created | "All that goes into a voice profile - basically a document that describes how you write." |
| SHOW: Profile summary appearing | "Here's what it found..." |
| SHOW: Profile highlights | "Uses contractions. Short sentences mixed with longer ones. Lots of parentheticals. (Sound familiar? lol)" |
| SHOW: Profile saved confirmation | "Profile saved. It'll use this going forward." |

**Production notes:**
- Self-referential joke about Seth's own style
- Show real-looking profile highlights
- Keep it moving - don't read every trait

## Section 5: Using Your Voice (45 seconds)

| VISUAL | AUDIO |
|--------|-------|
| SHOW: Terminal prompt | "Now for the payoff. Let's write something." |
| TYPE: `Draft an email to Sunrise Digital about the project kickoff` | "Draft an email to Sunrise Digital about the project kickoff." |
| SHOW: Claude generating email | "Claude writes it..." |
| SHOW: Email appears - noticeably in the trained style | "...and look at that. Contractions, direct sentences, no 'I hope this email finds you well' nonsense." |
| HIGHLIGHT: Style markers in the email | "That's not generic AI. That's my voice." |
| SHOW: Text overlay "Also works: 'write more casually' or 'more formal'" | "You can also tweak on the fly - say 'write more casually' or 'be more formal' and it adjusts." |

**Production notes:**
- Side-by-side with generic would be powerful if possible
- Highlight specific style markers that match the profile
- Modifier tip adds flexibility

---

## Section 6: Wrapping Up the Series (15 seconds)

| VISUAL | AUDIO |
|--------|-------|
| SHOW: Terminal with completed email | "That's voice training. Optional, but once you set it up, everything the AI writes sounds like you." |
| SHOW: Series title cards | "And that wraps up the intro series. Setup, clients, notes, voice - you've got the foundation." |
| SHOW: End card with links | "Docs have more advanced stuff. Links below. Go build something." |

**Production notes:**
- "Go build something" - action-oriented close
- No drawn-out goodbye
- Series wrap feels complete but not final

```
Train AnyManage to write in your voice.

Instead of generic AI output, you get emails and documents that sound like you wrote them.

How it works:
1. Start training: "Train my voice"
2. Pick a content type (emails, docs, chat)
3. Paste 3+ examples of your real writing
4. AI extracts your patterns and saves a voice profile
5. All future output uses your voice

Commands from the video:
Train my voice
Draft an email to Sunrise Digital about the project kickoff
