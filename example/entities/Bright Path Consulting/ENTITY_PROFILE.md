## Notes

### Background Context

Found us through industry association referral. Previously worked with a freelancer who wasn't scaling with their needs. Looking for more strategic partnership, not just execution.

### Working Style Preferences

Sarah prefers concise updates - bullet points over paragraphs. James wants to see ROI metrics, especially cost-per-lead. Emily is detail-oriented and appreciates thorough briefs.

### Things to Remember

- Partners are often traveling - schedule meetings with buffer time
- They're sensitive about brand voice - want to sound expert but approachable
- James mentioned competitor "Apex Consulting" often - avoid sounding similar
