## Key Context

- Sarah prefers Slack for quick questions; finds email overwhelming
- James checks big-picture items but trusts Sarah's judgment on execution
- Previously tried content marketing — never maintained consistency past 6 weeks
- Core frustration: "We know we should be doing this but don't have time"
- Partners travel often — schedule meetings with buffer time
- Sensitive about brand voice — want expert but approachable tone
- Avoid sounding like competitor "Apex Consulting"
