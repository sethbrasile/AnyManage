# Kick-off Call Notes - 2026-01-18

Attendees: Sarah Martinez, James Wright, us

## Discussion

Started with background - they've been meaning to get serious about marketing for 2 years. Had a freelancer helping but it was too tactical, no strategy.

Sarah owns marketing budget ($5k/mo for now, can grow if we show results). James wants to see ROI metrics - specifically cost per qualified lead.

Their ideal client is a company with 50-500 employees going through growth or transformation. They find these through referrals mostly, want to add inbound.

## What They Want

1. More qualified leads - currently getting about 8/month, want 12+
2. Thought leadership - partners want to be seen as experts
3. Better website - current one is embarrassing according to Sarah

## Notes

- Sarah prefers Slack over email
- James checks in monthly, trusts Sarah on day-to-day
- They've tried content before, never lasted more than 6 weeks
- Competitor Apex has been eating their lunch on Google

## Next Steps

- Get access to GA and social accounts
- Complete website audit by end of week
- Schedule weekly sync with Sarah
