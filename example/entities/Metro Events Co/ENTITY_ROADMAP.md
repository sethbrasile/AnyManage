## Notes

### Blockers and Risks

- Website launch deadline (Feb 1) is tight - no room for scope creep
- David's availability during wedding season may slow approvals
- Trade show (April) is fixed date - corporate page must be ready

### Decisions Needed

- [ ] Photography refresh - use existing or new shoot? - Due 2026-01-27
- [ ] Advertising budget split (Google vs Meta) - Due 2026-04-15

### General Notes

Strong engagement so far. David is bought into the strategy. Maria is excellent at execution. Main risk is timeline - lots to do before wedding season ramps up.
