## Upcoming Deadlines

| Date | Item | Urgency |
|------|------|---------|
| 2026-02-01 | Website redesign launch | HARD — peak wedding season starts |
| 2026-02-07 | Lead capture live | Normal |
| 2026-03-15 | Corporate landing page | Normal — before trade show |
| 2026-04-10 | Phoenix Business Expo presence | HARD — fixed date |

## Key Context

- David is analytical, data-driven; wants to understand "why" behind recommendations
- Risk-averse on paid ads — burned on Facebook; previous agency over-promised SEO results
- Budget firm at $8K/mo; may increase Q3 if results justify
- No competitor owns "boutique corporate events" positioning in Phoenix
- Website is the critical weakness — hurts credibility for corporate prospects
- Maria runs day-to-day, strong opinions, prefers checklists and clear deadlines
- Wedding season (May-Oct) = very busy, less responsive
- David checks Google rankings weekly — SEO results matter personally to him
- David wants to personally close corporate deals — won't delegate sales
