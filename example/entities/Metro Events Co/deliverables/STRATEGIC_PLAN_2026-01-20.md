## Risks and Mitigations

| Website launch delay | Medium | High | Start development immediately, have hard cutoff date, reduce scope if needed |
| Wedding season reduces availability | High | Medium | Front-load David's involvement, batch content creation before May |
| SEO takes longer than expected | Medium | Medium | Set realistic timeline expectations, focus on conversion from existing traffic while building SEO |
| Paid ads underperform | Medium | Medium | Start with small budget, test and validate before scaling, maintain organic focus |
| Trade show doesn't generate leads | Low | Low | Prepare strong collateral, follow-up system; leads are bonus, not core strategy |
