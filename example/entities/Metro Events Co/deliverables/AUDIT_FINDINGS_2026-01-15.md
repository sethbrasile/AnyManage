# Audit Findings: Metro Events Co

**Assessment Date:** 2026-01-15
**Assessment Type:** Current State / Gap Analysis

## Executive Summary

Metro Events Co has a strong reputation and loyal client base built through excellent service delivery, but their digital presence significantly undercuts their market potential. The website fails to convert corporate prospects, local SEO is essentially non-existent, and there's no lead capture mechanism. The good news: these are fixable technical and strategic gaps, not fundamental business problems. With focused investment in digital infrastructure, Metro can capture the corporate event market they're targeting.

## Strengths

**Service Delivery Excellence**
- 4.9 star rating across review platforms
- High client retention and referral rate
- Personal touch differentiates from larger competitors

**Market Position**
- Established reputation in Phoenix metro wedding market
- David's corporate network provides warm introduction opportunities
- Boutique positioning is unique in corporate events space

**Operational Foundation**
- Maria runs tight operations - execution won't be a bottleneck
- Team is responsive and client-focused
- Existing vendor relationships are strong

## Gaps and Issues

### Critical

**Website Fails Corporate Prospects**
- Current design screams "wedding planner" - no corporate appeal
- Mobile experience is broken (40% of traffic)
- Load time is 6+ seconds on mobile
- Zero conversion path beyond contact form
- **Impact:** Corporate prospects bounce immediately
- **Recommendation:** Complete redesign with corporate-focused messaging and clear conversion paths

**No Lead Capture System**
- Contact form is only way to engage
- No lead magnet or value exchange
- No email list building
- **Impact:** Losing 95%+ of interested visitors
- **Recommendation:** Implement lead capture with valuable resource offer

### Important

**Local SEO Non-Existent**
- Not ranking for any target keywords (page 3+ for "corporate event planning Phoenix")
- Google Business Profile has minimal optimization
- Only 23 reviews despite 4.9 rating
- No local schema markup on website
- **Impact:** Invisible to search-based prospects
- **Recommendation:** Comprehensive local SEO buildout including GBP optimization, review generation, and technical SEO fixes

**Content Thin and Stale**
- Blog hasn't been updated in 8 months
- Only 12 indexed pages total (competitors average 50+)
- No corporate event content exists
- **Impact:** No organic traffic growth, poor search authority
- **Recommendation:** Content strategy with corporate event focus, case studies, and thought leadership

### Minor

**Social Media Inconsistent**
- Posting frequency varies wildly (3x/week to nothing for weeks)
- Instagram portfolio is outdated
- No LinkedIn presence (critical for corporate)
- **Impact:** Missed engagement and brand building opportunities
- **Recommendation:** Structured content calendar with LinkedIn priority for corporate targeting

**Analytics Incomplete**
- Google Analytics exists but not configured properly
- No conversion tracking
- No heatmapping or user behavior data
- **Impact:** Can't measure or optimize performance
- **Recommendation:** Full analytics implementation before major changes

## Opportunities

**Corporate Events White Space**
Competitors either focus on weddings (Desert Bloom) or high-end corporate only (Phoenix Premier). "Boutique corporate events" is an unoccupied positioning that leverages Metro's personal-touch strength.

**David's Network**
David's corporate background and contacts are underutilized. Personal outreach combined with strong digital presence could accelerate corporate market entry.

**Thought Leadership Platform**
David's expertise and speaking ability could establish Metro as the go-to voice for corporate event planning in Phoenix. No competitor is doing this.

**Trade Show Opportunity**
Phoenix Business Expo in April provides corporate visibility - need digital presence ready to capture interest.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Website Redesign (Immediate)** - Launch by Feb 1 before peak season. Prioritize corporate messaging, mobile experience, and lead capture.

2. **Local SEO Foundation (Weeks 1-4)** - GBP optimization, review generation system, technical SEO fixes, local schema.

3. **Corporate Content Development (Weeks 2-8)** - Corporate event case studies, landing page, blog content targeting corporate keywords.

4. **Analytics Infrastructure (Week 1)** - Proper GA4 setup, conversion tracking, baseline metrics before changes.

5. **Strategic Plan Development** - Develop comprehensive 6-month strategy based on these findings.
