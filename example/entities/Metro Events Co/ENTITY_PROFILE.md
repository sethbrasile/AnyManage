## Notes

### Background Context

David started Metro Events after a corporate career. Built the business on wedding referrals but sees bigger opportunity in corporate events where budgets are larger and bookings more consistent. Previous marketing agency was too generic - didn't understand events industry.

### Working Style Preferences

David is strategic thinker, wants to understand the "why" behind recommendations. Maria is execution-focused, appreciates clear checklists and deadlines. Both prefer calls over long emails. David has mentioned wanting to eventually write a book about event planning.

### Things to Remember

- Wedding season (May-October) means they're very busy and less responsive
- Corporate clients often found through Chamber of Commerce and BNI networking
- They've been burned by agencies promising SEO results and not delivering
- David's daughter just graduated college - she may join the business
- They're considering expanding to Scottsdale in 2027

| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses | Notes |
|------------|-----------|------------|-------|
| Desert Bloom Events | Beautiful website, strong Instagram | Higher prices, impersonal | Wedding-focused only |
| Phoenix Premier Events | Corporate connections, polished | Expensive, corporate only | David's main target |
| Sunset Celebrations | Affordable, volume | Quality inconsistent | Not direct competition |
