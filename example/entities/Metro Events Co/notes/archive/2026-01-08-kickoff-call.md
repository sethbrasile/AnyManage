# Kick-off Call Notes - 2026-01-08

Attendees: David Park, Maria Santos, us

## Background

David started Metro Events in 2018 after leaving corporate career. Built business on weddings through word-of-mouth. Now at ~60 weddings/year plus misc private events.

Wants to break into corporate events - bigger budgets, more consistent revenue, less seasonal. Has some corporate contacts from his previous career but hasn't leveraged them.

## Current State

- Website is "embarrassing" according to David - built 5 years ago
- Social media is inconsistent - Lisa (part-time) handles it when she can
- Getting about 15 inquiries/month, closing maybe 40%
- Corporate inquiries are rare - maybe 1-2/month
- Reviews are great but not enough of them

## What They Want

1. Website that attracts corporate clients (not just brides)
2. Show up on Google when people search event planning Phoenix
3. System to capture leads and follow up
4. Content that positions David as an expert

## Budget/Timeline

- $8K/month budget
- Website needs to launch by Feb 1 (before peak season)
- 12-month commitment, wants to see measurable results by Q2

## Notes

- David checks rankings weekly - important metric for him
- Previous agency disappointed them - be careful with SEO promises
- Maria runs operations, very execution-focused
- David wants to understand strategy, not just receive reports

## Next Steps

- Get access to analytics, social accounts, hosting
- Complete current state audit
- Competitive analysis
- Present assessment findings
