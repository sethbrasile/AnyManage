# Strategy Presentation Notes - 2026-01-19

Attendees: David Park, Maria Santos, us

## Presentation Recap

Walked through 6-month strategic plan. David appreciated the data-driven approach and competitive analysis.

## Feedback

David's concerns:
- Paid advertising - got burned before on Facebook, wants to be cautious
- Timeline feels aggressive but agrees website is priority
- Wants to personally handle corporate sales, not automate too much

Maria's input:
- Suggested "corporate lunch preview" as lead magnet idea
- Asked about workflow for content approval
- Wants clear ownership on each deliverable

## Revisions Requested

1. Add more detail on SEO approach - David wants to understand what we're doing
2. Clarify paid ads as Phase 2, not immediate
3. Include David in corporate content planning - he wants to review messaging
4. Add contingency time before trade show

## Budget Discussion

$8K/month confirmed. David mentioned potential increase in Q3 if website and SEO show results. Not interested in cutting budget to test - wants full effort.

## Approval

Revisions to be completed by EOD tomorrow. Final approval expected 1/20.

## Next Steps

- Revise strategy doc with feedback
- Send updated version for sign-off
- Begin website wireframes immediately
- Schedule weekly syncs with Maria
