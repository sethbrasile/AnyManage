# Voice Profile Storage

This directory stores project-level voice profiles as a fallback location.

**Storage priority:**
1. User home: `~/.anymanage/voice/voice_profile.md` (primary - portable across projects)
2. Project: `ops/voice/voice_profile.md` (fallback - if home not found)

Agent checks home directory first, then falls back to project level.

**Files in this directory:**
- `voice_profile.md` - Main voice profile (created after training)
- `CORRECTIONS.md` - Append-only correction log (optional, for async learning)

**Note:** Home directory location (`~/.anymanage/voice/`) is created by the voice training process, not pre-created here.
