### Important extraction guidelines:

**Focus on patterns, not content:**
- Extract HOW I write (style, structure, tone)
- Don't memorize WHAT I wrote (names, details, sensitive info)
- Look for recurring patterns across samples

**Be specific, not generic:**
- ❌ "Uses casual tone"
- ✅ "Starts emails with 'Hey -' or 'Quick update:' never 'Dear' or 'Hello'"
- ❌ "Likes short sentences"
- ✅ "Average 12 words/sentence, mix of 5-word punches and 20-word explanations"

**Include concrete examples:**
- For every pattern, cite examples from my samples
- Show DO/DON'T comparisons
- List actual phrases I use vs. avoid

**Capture my anti-patterns:**
- What do I specifically avoid?
- What sounds wrong in my voice?
- What would AI typically generate that I'd never say?

## AFTER EXTRACTION IS COMPLETE

Once you receive your voice profile from Claude Desktop or ChatGPT web:

1. **Copy the entire profile** (everything from `# [Your Name] - Voice Profile` to the end)

2. **Return to AnyManage** (your terminal session)

3. **Paste the profile and say:**
   ```
   Here's my voice profile:

   [paste the complete profile]
   ```

4. **AnyManage will save it** to `~/.anymanage/voice/voice_profile.md`

5. **Your voice is now active** - the system will use it automatically when writing emails, docs, chat messages, and reports

---

## Tips for Best Results

**Provide quality samples:**
- Use recent writing (your voice may have evolved)
- Include variety (different recipients, topics, lengths)
- Use YOUR actual writing (not AI-generated or heavily edited)
- 5-10 samples per content type is ideal

**Review the profile:**
- Read through before copying it back
- Make sure it sounds like you
- Check that examples are specific, not generic
- Verify anti-patterns section captures what you'd never say

**Iterate if needed:**
- If profile doesn't sound like you, add more samples
- Provide feedback: "I'm more casual than this" or "I never use that much jargon"
- Re-run extraction with adjusted focus
