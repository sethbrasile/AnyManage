## Strategy

### Phase 1: [Phase Name] (Months 1-3)
**Objective:** [What this phase achieves — the milestone we're reaching]

**Key Activities:**
- [Activity 1 — specific action with clear outcome]
- [Activity 2 — specific action with clear outcome]
- [Activity 3 — specific action with clear outcome]

**Success Metrics:**
- [Metric 1]: [Target — how we measure this phase's success]
- [Metric 2]: [Target — how we measure this phase's success]

### Phase 2: [Phase Name] (Months 4-6)
**Objective:** [What this phase achieves — the milestone we're reaching]

**Key Activities:**
- [Activity 1 — specific action with clear outcome]
- [Activity 2 — specific action with clear outcome]
- [Activity 3 — specific action with clear outcome]

**Success Metrics:**
- [Metric 1]: [Target — how we measure this phase's success]
- [Metric 2]: [Target — how we measure this phase's success]

### Phase 3: [Phase Name] (Months 7-12) [Optional — depends on planning horizon]
**Objective:** [What this phase achieves — the milestone we're reaching]

**Key Activities:**
- [Activity 1 — specific action with clear outcome]

## Resource Requirements

[What's needed to execute — be specific about costs, people, tools, time]

- **Budget:** [Estimated costs with breakdown]
- **Team:** [Required roles, time commitment, skill level]
- **Tools/Technology:** [Systems and platforms needed, including any new purchases]
- **Timeline:** [Overall duration with key milestones]

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| [Specific risk] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [Concrete approach to reduce or manage risk] |
| [Specific risk] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [Concrete approach to reduce or manage risk] |
| [Specific risk] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [Concrete approach to reduce or manage risk] |

## Success Metrics

[How we'll know the strategy is working — measurable outcomes with baselines and targets]

- [Metric 1]: [Current baseline] → [Target] ([Timeframe])
- [Metric 2]: [Current baseline] → [Target] ([Timeframe])
- [Metric 3]: [Current baseline] → [Target] ([Timeframe])
