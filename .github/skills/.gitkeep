# Skill Directory - Cross-Platform (Recommended)

This directory contains skills that work across all agents:
- Claude Code
- GitHub Copilot
- opencode
- Other Agent Skills 1.0 compatible tools

This is the recommended location for skills per Agent Skills 1.0 standard (Dec 2025).

Agent-specific directories (`.claude/skills/`, `.opencode/skills/`) can override these.
