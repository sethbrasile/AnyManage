# Domain Knowledge Layer

This directory contains domain-specific knowledge - industry playbooks, frameworks, and best practices.

## Purpose

Domain knowledge provides specialists with industry-specific expertise. When a specialist runs an assessment or develops a strategy, they load relevant domain knowledge to apply appropriate frameworks and standards.

## Organization

For single-domain setups:
```
docs/domain/
  MARKETING_PLAYBOOK.md
  SEO_FRAMEWORKS.md
  ANALYTICS_CHECKLIST.md
```

For multi-domain setups, use subfolders:
```
docs/domain/
  marketing/
    PLAYBOOK.md
    SEO_FRAMEWORKS.md
  legal/
    COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md
    CONTRACT_STANDARDS.md
  healthcare/
    HIPAA_GUIDELINES.md
```

CONFIG.md can specify the active domain for multi-domain configurations.

## Usage

Specialists load domain knowledge as part of their four-layer knowledge protocol:

1. **Layer 1 - Base PM**: Core protocols (INSTRUCTIONS.md)
2. **Layer 2 - Domain**: Industry playbooks (docs/domain/)
3. **Layer 3 - Agency**: Company SOPs (ops/preferences/, ops/processes/, ops/style/)
4. **Layer 4 - Entity**: Client/project context (entities/[Entity]/knowledge/)

Domain knowledge is loaded based on relevance to the task. Specialists use progressive loading - summaries first, details as needed.

## Examples

- Marketing agency: SEO playbooks, content frameworks, campaign checklists
- Legal practice: Compliance standards, contract templates, regulatory guidelines
- Healthcare: Clinical protocols, HIPAA guidelines, treatment frameworks
- Software development: Architecture patterns, security standards, testing protocols
