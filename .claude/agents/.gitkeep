# Specialist Subagent Definitions

This directory contains specialist subagent definitions (domain expert AI personas).

## Purpose

Specialists are AI subagents with domain expertise that produce structured deliverables. They differ from skills in fundamental ways:

- **Skills** = Reusable procedures anyone can follow (process-notes, get-status, weekly-review)
- **Specialists** = Domain expert personas with judgment and expertise (assessment-specialist, strategy-specialist)

Skills run in the main conversation context. Specialists run in isolated context windows with custom system prompts.

## File Format

Each specialist is a `.md` file with:

1. **YAML frontmatter**: Metadata (name, description, tools, model)
2. **Markdown body**: System prompt with knowledge loading instructions

Example:
```yaml
---
name: assessment-specialist
description: Domain expert for conducting assessments and audits
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Write
model: sonnet
---

You are an assessment specialist...
```

## Storage Locations

- **Project specialists**: `.claude/agents/` (this directory) - committed to repo
- **Personal specialists**: `~/.claude/agents/` - user-specific, not committed

## Entity Folder Structure

Specialists interact with entity folders following this convention:

```
entities/[Entity]/
  knowledge/         - Learned context from specialist work
  deliverables/      - Specialist output files
  internal/          - Internal-only content (pricing, margins, notes)
```

These folders are created per-entity by the entity onboarding protocol as needed.

## Usage

Users invoke specialists naturally:
- "Run assessment for Acme"
- "Use assessment-specialist for Acme"
- "Run assessment for all clients"

Specialists announce before starting, produce deliverables, and return brief summaries.
