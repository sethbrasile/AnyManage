# AnyManage

**Manage anything with AI conversation.** No technical skills required. Clients, projects, patients, products — whatever you track.

## Quick Start

**One command:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anymanage.git && cd anymanage && claude
```

Then type: `Help me set up`

The AI asks what you're managing (clients, projects, products, etc.) and configures everything for your use case.

## What You Can Do

- **Add new items:** "Add new [entity]" (e.g., "Add new client Acme" or "Add new project Alpha")
- **Process notes:** "Process notes for [name]"
- **Get status:** "Show me [name]'s status"
- **Run assessments:** "Run assessment for [name]"
- **Weekly review:** "Run weekly review"

Just talk to it naturally. You don't need to memorize commands.
