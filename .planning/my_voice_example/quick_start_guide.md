# Quick Start Guide: Using Seth's Voice with LLMs

Get started in 5 minutes. This is your TL;DR for the complete methodology.

---

## The Fastest Way to Start

### Copy-Paste This Prompt Template

```
Draft an email in Seth Brasile's voice.

VOICE CHARACTERISTICS:
- Direct, no fluff. Skip "I hope this finds you well" and "I wanted to reach out"
- Mix short punchy sentences with longer ones
- Use contractions liberally: "I've" "don't" "we're"
- Add parenthetical asides for context: (like this)
- Strategic hedging: "I imagine..." "probably" "I'm betting..."
- Self-deprecating humor with "lol" to soften
- No formal transitions (avoid "Additionally," "Furthermore")
- Specific examples over vague descriptions

NEVER USE:
- "I hope this email finds you well"
- "I wanted to reach out/follow up"
- "At your earliest convenience"
- "Please don't hesitate"
- Over-enthusiasm

CONTEXT:
Recipient: [NAME]
Relationship: [Professional client / Business partner / Family member client]
Purpose: [What you need to accomplish]

KEY POINTS TO INCLUDE:
- [Bullet point 1]
- [Bullet point 2]
- [Bullet point 3]
```

**Just fill in the bracketed sections and paste into your LLM.**

## For Email: 3-Step Process

### Step 1: Gather Info (30 seconds)
- Who am I emailing?
- What do I need from them OR what am I telling them?
- Any special context about our relationship?

### Step 2: Paste Template + Info (60 seconds)
Fill in the template above with your specific details.

### Step 3: Quick Edit (60 seconds)
Review the AI output for these common mistakes:
- Did it use "I hope this finds you well"? → Delete
- Is it using "I wanted to reach out"? → Delete
- Are paragraphs too long? → Break into 2-3 sentence chunks
- Is there at least one parenthetical aside? → Add if missing
- Does humor end with "lol"? → Add if missing
- Is the closing specific? → Make it actionable

**Total time: ~2.5 minutes per email**

---

## For Code Documentation: The Pattern

```
You're writing technical documentation in Seth's voice for [PROJECT].

VOICE:
- Start simple, build to complex
- Use analogies: "It's kind of like..."
- Show your thinking: "I'm imagining..."
- Be specific with real values
- Acknowledge gaps: "I have no idea how this works"
- Invite collaboration: "if you guys want we can figure this out together"
- Mix prose with code
- Don't hide complexity, explain it progressively

DOCUMENT:
[What needs documenting]

AUDIENCE:
[Who's reading this? Their skill level?]
```

## The 5-Second Voice Check

Before sending ANY LLM-drafted content, ask:

**"Would this sound weird if I said it out loud?"**

If yes → it's probably too formal. Make it more conversational.

## Most Common Fixes

### Problem: Too Formal
**AI wrote:** "I wanted to follow up regarding the timeline for the project."
**Fix:** "I'll get back to you on that timeline as soon as I can."

### Problem: Too Wordy
**AI wrote:** "I appreciate your patience as we work through these details."
**Fix:** Delete this sentence entirely.

### Problem: Generic Closing
**AI wrote:** "Please let me know if you have any questions."
**Fix:** "Let me know if anything above needs adjustment." (specific to context)

### Problem: Missing Personality
**AI wrote:** "Could you provide the contract for review?"
**Fix:** "Could you send over a copy of your standard wedding contract? I'll probably do some editing with chatgpt and send it back. Let me know if yours was like high-dollar lawyer stuff though lol."

---

## Family Member Client: Special Rule

Add this to your prompt:

```
SPECIAL NOTE: This recipient is a family member.
- Still professional about project details
- Slightly warmer but maintain boundaries
- No emojis
- Don't reference family relationship unless contextually needed
Use knowledge of personal relationship to inform tone, but don't get weird about it.
```

## When You're Really Short on Time

Use these ultra-short prompts for quick responses:

**For "Thank You" Emails:**
```
Write a brief thank you in Seth's voice. One or two sentences max.
```
Output: "Gotcha. Thank you!" or just "Thank you!"

**For Simple Confirmations:**
```
Write a brief confirmation in Seth's voice. One sentence.
```
Output: "Yup perfect! Thank you!"

**For Quick Updates:**
```
Write a brief update in Seth's voice: [what happened]
```

---

## Saving Your Corrections

Every time you edit an AI draft, save it like this:

```
**What AI Wrote:**
[paste]

**What I Changed It To:**
[paste]

**Why:**
[note the pattern]
```

After 5-10 of these, add common patterns to your base prompt:
```
BASED ON MY EDITING PATTERNS:
- I tend to remove [X] and replace with [Y]
- I always change [PATTERN] to [PATTERN]
```

### Week 2: Add Relationship Context
Start noting relationship types in your prompts (professional client, business partner, etc.)

### Week 3: Add Your Edit Patterns
Note what you're consistently changing and add those patterns to your base prompt

## Emergency Cheat Sheet

**If you forget everything else, remember these 3 rules:**

1. **No "I hope this finds you well"** - Just start talking
2. **Add parentheses** - Include at least one parenthetical aside
3. **End with action** - Specific next steps, not "let me know if you have questions"

That alone will make AI sound 10x more like you.

---

## Getting Help

If an AI draft feels off but you can't pinpoint why:

Ask the LLM:
```
Review this against Seth's voice profile. What makes it sound like AI instead of a human? What specific phrases or patterns should I change?
```

Then apply those changes.

## Practice Exercise

Try this right now to test the system:

**Scenario:** Email your client Diana that you need her to send printer specifications before your designer can start the brochure.

**Step 1:** Fill in the template
**Step 2:** Generate the draft
**Step 3:** Check it against the 5-second voice check
**Step 4:** Make edits

**Should take ~3 minutes total.**

---

## What Not to Overthink

Don't stress about:
- Perfect grammar (comma splices are fine)
- Being "professional enough" (you have your own style)
- Matching every single pattern (it's a guide, not rules)
- Getting it perfect on first draft (quick edits are expected)

Do focus on:
- No corporate fluff
- Specific not vague
- Helpful not formal
- Personality over polish

## Files in This Methodology

You now have 4 documents:

1. **seth_voice_profile.md** - Complete voice analysis (reference document)
2. **llm_implementation_guide.md** - Detailed modular prompts (when you need depth)
3. **before_after_examples.md** - Real transformations (learning examples)
4. **THIS FILE** - Quick start (daily use)

**For daily email writing:** Use this file
**For understanding why:** Read voice profile
**For complex scenarios:** Reference implementation guide
**For examples:** Check before/after doc

## One Last Thing

The goal isn't to make AI write *exactly* like you every time. The goal is to make it write something that:
- Takes you 30 seconds to edit instead of 3 minutes
- Doesn't make you cringe
- Sounds human, not corporate
- Gets the job done

You've got this.

*Start with the basic template and build from there. Most improvement comes from just removing the AI clichés.*
