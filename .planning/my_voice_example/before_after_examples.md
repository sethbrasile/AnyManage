## EXAMPLE 1: Project Update Email

### Context
Client asking about timeline for deliverable. You're waiting on dependencies.

### ❌ AI-Typical Draft

```
Subject: Re: Project Timeline

Dear Diana,

I hope this email finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding the timeline for the brochure project.

I wanted to update you on our progress. Currently, we are in the process of coordinating with our graphic designer to determine availability. While I am optimistic that we will be able to begin work soon, I am unfortunately unable to provide a definitive timeline at this moment.

Additionally, there are a few items we need from your end in order to proceed efficiently. First, we will need the specifications from your printing company to ensure that our design work meets their requirements. Second, we would appreciate it if you could grant access to your Google Drive folder to the following team members: samuel@pricklypearmarketingco.com and andrew@pricklypearmarketingco.com.

Please feel free to coordinate directly with your printer regarding specifications, or we would be happy to handle that communication on your behalf, whichever you prefer.

Thank you for your patience and understanding. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

Best regards,
Seth
```

**Problems:**
- Opens with "I hope this email finds you well"
- "I wanted to update you" instead of just updating
- "Additionally" transition
- "Please feel free" / "don't hesitate" clichés
- Way too formal overall
- No parenthetical asides
- Too many words for simple information

Subject: Re: Project Timeline

Diana,

I will figure that out and get back to you as soon as I can. I'm currently trying to get my graphic designer to give me a date when he can work on it. I'm sure it can be soon but I'm not sure exactly when yet.

Could you invite a couple more people to that google drive? samuel@pricklypearmarketingco.com and andrew@pricklypearmarketingco.com

Could you also give me the information from your printer so that I can confirm dimensions with them? If you want to talk to them about that bigger mailer size first, feel free, or I can talk to them, either way. Ideally we have dimensions and constraints from your printer before graphic designer starts.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Direct opening with name only
- Honest about uncertainty: "I'm not sure exactly when yet"
- Short, specific requests
- Casual: "a couple more people"
- Natural hedge: "Ideally we have..."
- No formality, just helpful information

## EXAMPLE 2: Technical Question Email

### Context
Asking colleague about access to admin panel and several technical questions about requirements.

### ❌ AI-Typical Draft

```
Subject: Request for Admin Access and Clarification Questions

Hi Martin,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out regarding access to the Moodle admin panel.

I've been exploring the platform using the student login credentials you provided, which has been quite helpful for understanding the user experience. However, as I delve deeper into the technical implementation, I find myself needing administrative access to properly evaluate certain features, particularly the import/export functionality and webhook plugin capabilities.

Furthermore, I have several questions regarding the course materials that I wanted to clarify before proceeding:

First, I noticed that while Level 2 has a participant guide, I haven't been able to locate a similar document for Level 3. I'm wondering if this document exists and if you could provide it.

Second, I wanted to confirm the requirements regarding the PDF slide content. Specifically, I'm curious whether we need to transfer the content verbatim, or if we have flexibility to create summaries and add supplementary discussion points, provided the information remains accurate and properly ordered.

Third, I wanted to explore whether Moodle supports native slide functionality that might provide a better user experience than displaying static PDF files.

I apologize if some of these questions are things Sam might already know - I haven't had a chance to check with him yet, but I thought it would be best to go directly to the source given how foundational these answers are to my work.

Thank you very much for your time and assistance. Please let me know if you need any additional information from me.

Best regards,
Seth
```

**Problems:**
- "I hope you're doing well"
- "I wanted to reach out"
- "Furthermore" transition
- Overly elaborate: "as I delve deeper into the technical implementation"
- Numbers written out: "First, Second, Third" 
- "I apologize if" is too formal
- Way too wordy
- No personality

Subject: Moodle Access and some questions

Martin,

Could I get access to the admin side of moodle? The login I've got appears to only be a student login, and it has been helpful, but I'm finding myself needing to see the admin side. I need to see what import/export looks like and etc..

After spending some time in moodle, I think you made a great choice, I don't think what I was going to come up with was going to be better in any way, except possibly integration with other systems, so that is what I'm diving into now. GHL courses are very much inferior to this platform for this use-case. I believe I can achieve everything we need to achieve via webhooks from moodle. That's another reason I need access to the admin side, so I can see if the available webhook plugin can do what we need.

Separately, I have some questions about the PDF slides. Apologies if Sam already knows the answers, I didn't ask him first. I figured I might as well check with the source since my questions are a bit foundational to what I'm doing here. I'm taking over the course content from Sam so he can focus on video production.

1. I don't see a "participant guide" for level 3.. but I imagine there is one? Could I get that? In the level 3 course on moodle, it looks like the ultimate source of truth is the slides, but in my level 2 folder the ultimate source of truth is the participant guide. Feels like we're maybe missing an asset?

2. Do the PDF slides' (the ones with the blue background) content need to be transferred over verbatim? As long as it's in the right order and the information is derived from the source of truth, can we deviate with summaries? Can we liven it up with discussions and examples? I'm imagining in a real life class there would be those things, and I'm imagining handing the modules one at a time to an LLM and asking it to create a lesson plan and summaries for that content, but don't want to bother if the requirement is those slides verbatim.

3. I haven't been into moodle admin yet, so I don't know for sure, but I imagine that moodle has the ability to replace those PDF slides with its own slides functionality, and I imagine users will have a better experience if we can transform the slides content into that native moodle slides format instead of just displaying a static asset (i.e. pdf/ppt) - let me know if my thinking is wrong
```

**Why This Works:**
- Gets right to the request
- Shows his process: "After spending some time in moodle..."
- Genuine compliment: "I think you made a great choice"
- "Separately," to shift topics (not "Furthermore")
- Self-aware: "Apologies if Sam already knows"
- Numbered questions (1, 2, 3)
- Parenthetical clarifications: "(the ones with the blue background)"
- Shows thinking: "I'm imagining..."
- Hedging: "I don't know for sure, but I imagine..."
- "and etc.." is casual

## EXAMPLE 3: Meeting Follow-Up

### Context
Following up after meeting with venue client to summarize what you need from them and what you'll deliver.

### ❌ AI-Typical Draft

```
Subject: Follow-Up: Summary of Action Items from Our Meeting

Dear Tracie and Danielle,

I hope this message finds you both well. I wanted to take a moment to follow up on our productive meeting and provide you with a comprehensive summary of the action items and next steps we discussed.

To ensure we're all aligned and can move forward efficiently, I've organized this email into two main sections: items we'll need from you, and items our team will be handling internally.

**Items Requested from Willowood Ranch:**

We would greatly appreciate it if you could provide us with the following materials at your earliest convenience:

1. Standard Wedding Contract: Tracie, if possible, please forward a copy of your current wedding contract template. We plan to review and potentially make some refinements using AI assistance, and we'll send our suggestions back to you for approval. However, if this contract was professionally drafted by legal counsel, please let us know so we can proceed with appropriate caution.

2. Premium Date Pricing Structure: We discussed implementing higher pricing for high-demand dates. Could you please provide us with a list of these dates along with the corresponding premium pricing?

[continues for several more paragraphs...]

Thank you both so much for your time and collaboration. We're excited to move forward with this project. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or if anything requires clarification.

Warm regards,
Seth
```

**Problems:**
- "I hope this message finds you both well"
- "I wanted to take a moment to follow up"
- "at your earliest convenience"
- Way too formal and wordy
- No personality or humor
- "Warm regards" is not Seth
- Over-explains everything

### ✅ Seth's Voice

```
Subject: Meeting Summary

Hello!

Based on our discussion, here is a summary of what we need from you to move forward, followed by the short-term action items for our team.

What We Need From You:

- **Wedding Contract**: Tracie, please send over a copy of your standard wedding contract. I will likely do some editing with chatgpt and send it back to you for review. Let me know if yours was like high-dollar lawyer stuff and that I should use it as-is. In my experience, chatgpt does better than the lawyer lol.

- **In-Demand Dates Pricing info**: We talked about a higher price for higher demand dates. I need those dates and I need the higher prices.

- **Booking Prerequisites**: We need a definitive list of requirements and timelines for weddings (e.g., "Damage deposit due 30 days prior").
  - **Note**: Please clarify the consequence and messaging for missed deadlines (e.g., "Gates locked if damage deposit not received" versus "we will cancel your reservation and return your deposit minus an xx fee")
  - These ARE helpful for messaging. People understand boundaries and rules and accept them with grace as long as you're clear and up front.

Our Action Items (Sam & Seth):

- **Website & Funnels**:
  - Finalize the calendar implementation and high-speed static site (https://willowood-ranch.pages.dev/) to serve as the immediate engine for calendars and funnels.
  - Build a private booking page for direct payments (hiding dates/prices publicly). You can choose to use (or not use) as you see fit.
  - Create a "Hero Video" section highlighting packages ($1,500 - $15,000) to inspire potential couples.

Let us know if anything above needs adjustment.
```

**Why This Works:**
- "Hello!" is warm but brief
- "Based on our discussion" gets right to it
- Clear structure with bold headers
- Humor: "In my experience, chatgpt does better than the lawyer lol"
- Specific examples: "e.g., 'Damage deposit due 30 days prior'"
- Nested bullets for sub-points
- Direct requests: "I need those dates and I need the higher prices"
- Practical insight: "People understand boundaries..."
- Closes with action: "Let us know if anything above needs adjustment"

## EXAMPLE 4: Very Short Response

### Context
Colleague sent you information you requested.

### ❌ AI-Typical Draft

```
Subject: Re: Instructor Guide

Hi Tom,

Thank you so much for sending over the Instructor Guide! I really appreciate you taking the time to share this with me. This will be incredibly helpful as we move forward with the project.

I've received the file and will review it thoroughly. If I have any questions after going through it, I'll be sure to reach out.

Thanks again for your help!

Best,
Seth
```

**Problems:**
- Way too many words for a simple acknowledgment
- Fake enthusiasm
- Unnecessary explanation of what you'll do with it
- "Thanks again" after already saying thank you

### ✅ Seth's Voice

```
Subject: Re: Instructor Guide

Thank you!
```

**Why This Works:**
- Two words
- Says everything that needs to be said
- Doesn't waste anyone's time

**Alternative Seth Version:**

```
Gotcha. Thank you!
```

## EXAMPLE 5: Asking for Clarification

### Context
Client mentioned adding license numbers to brochure but you don't understand what kind of license.

### ❌ AI-Typical Draft

```
Subject: Re: License Information

Hi Diana,

Thank you for that information. I just wanted to clarify something before we proceed with incorporating this into the brochure design.

When you mention the Louisiana and Arkansas license numbers, could you please specify what type of licenses these are? I want to make sure we use the correct terminology in the brochure (for example, whether these should be labeled as "State Construction License" or something more specific).

I apologize for my lack of familiarity with this - I just want to ensure we label everything accurately in the final design.

Thank you for your patience with my questions!

Best regards,
Seth
```

**Problems:**
- "Thank you for that information" (unnecessary)
- "I just wanted to clarify" (just clarify!)
- Too apologetic
- Over-explains why you're asking
- "Thank you for your patience" (ugh)

### ✅ Seth's Voice

```
Subject: Re: License Information

Apologies for my ignorance, but what is this license for? Is this something vague like "State Construction License" lol - this is just for my own information, I won't use this language on the brochure.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Self-deprecating: "Apologies for my ignorance"
- Shows his thinking: "Is this something vague like..."
- "lol" softens the question
- Clarifies intent: "this is just for my own information"
- Gets to the point

## EXAMPLE 6: Update with Change of Plans

### Context
You said you'd need admin access but you figured out a workaround.

### ❌ AI-Typical Draft

```
Subject: Update: Admin Access No Longer Needed

Hi Martin,

I wanted to follow up on my previous request for admin access to Moodle. 

I've been doing some additional exploration and I'm pleased to inform you that I've found a workaround that should meet my immediate needs. I was able to set up a local instance of Moodle, which will allow me to conduct the necessary development and testing activities without requiring access to the production admin panel.

That being said, there's a possibility I may need admin access in the future, so I wanted to keep that option open if it's not too much trouble.

Thank you for your understanding and flexibility on this matter.

Best regards,
Seth
```

**Problems:**
- "I wanted to follow up"
- "I'm pleased to inform you"
- "conducting necessary development and testing activities" (too formal)
- "if it's not too much trouble"
- Too wordy for a simple update

### ✅ Seth's Voice

```
Subject: Re: Moodle Access

Martin,

Update: I spun up a moodle instance locally so I probably have what I need on the request for admin access. I can do the dev things I need here for now. I will likely eventually need admin access though.
```

**Why This Works:**
- "Update:" is clean and direct
- "spun up" is natural technical language
- "probably have what I need" (hedging)
- "the dev things" (casual)
- Notes future need without apologizing
- Gets in and out fast

## KEY PATTERNS TO NOTICE

Across all these examples, notice:

1. **Seth never apologizes for asking questions** - he might say "Apologies for my ignorance" (with humor) but never "I apologize for the inconvenience"

2. **Parenthetical asides add personality** - "(the ones with the blue background)" or "(like high-dollar lawyer stuff)"

3. **"lol" is his softener** - uses it when making a joke or potentially awkward statement

4. **Hedging shows honesty** - "I imagine..." "probably" "I'm betting that..." invites collaboration

5. **Specific examples over vague descriptions** - "e.g., 'Damage deposit due 30 days prior'" not "such as various requirements"

6. **Bullets and bold for scannability** - but only when there are actually multiple items

7. **Technical language is casual but precise** - "spin up" "dev things" but also specific values

8. **Closes with action** - "Let us know if anything above needs adjustment" not "let me know if you have questions"

9. **Very short is okay** - "Thank you!" is a complete email when that's all that's needed

10. **No fluff** - every sentence serves a purpose

---

## ANTI-PATTERNS (What to Always Remove)

If you see these in an AI draft, delete them immediately:

- ❌ "I hope this email finds you well"
- ❌ "I wanted to reach out"
- ❌ "I wanted to follow up"
- ❌ "Thank you in advance"
- ❌ "At your earliest convenience"
- ❌ "Please don't hesitate"
- ❌ "Thank you for your patience"
- ❌ "I apologize for any inconvenience"
- ❌ "Best regards" / "Warm regards"
- ❌ "I look forward to hearing from you"

Replace with:
- ✅ Just start talking
- ✅ Direct requests
- ✅ Specific timelines
- ✅ Brief thanks when appropriate
- ✅ Just your signature (no closing phrase)

---

*Use these examples as templates. When drafting similar emails, reference the appropriate before/after example.*
