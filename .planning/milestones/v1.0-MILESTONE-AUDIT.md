# Milestone v1 Audit Report

**Project:** Agent PM
**Milestone:** v1
**Audited:** 2026-01-25T22:30:00Z
**Status:** TECH DEBT (all requirements met, non-critical debt to review)

---

## Cross-Phase Integration

**Score:** 98/100

### Verified Integration Points

- Phase 1 → Phase 3: Templates consumed by entity-onboarding
- Phase 2 → All Phases: INSTRUCTIONS.md references all subsystems (12 protocols)
- Phase 3 → Phase 4: Skills reference entity protocols
- Phase 4 → Phase 3: Core skills backed by protocols
- Phase 5 → Phase 3: Specialists implement 4-layer knowledge loading
- Phase 5 → Phase 6: Specialists integrate voice application
- Phase 6 → Phase 3: Voice training references entity context
- Phase 7 → All Phases: Documentation covers all subsystems
- Phase 8 → Phase 4: Integration skills implement framework
- Phase 8 → Phase 2: Session startup checks integrations

### E2E Flows Verified

1. **Onboarding → Deliverable**: Entity creation → notes → assessment → strategy
2. **Voice Training → Application**: Training → profile → specialist deliverable
3. **Integration Setup → Sync**: Add integration → sync tasks

### Integration Findings

- **Zero broken connections** between phases
- **Zero orphaned exports** — all deliverables consumed
- **Zero missing dependencies** — all prerequisites satisfied
- **Consistent knowledge layering** across specialists
- **Graceful degradation** throughout (voice, integrations, domain all optional)

## Tech Debt

### Phase 5: Missing VERIFICATION.md

**Severity:** LOW

**Details:** Phase 5 (Specialist Pattern) has complete plan summaries (05-01, 05-02, 05-03) showing all work completed, but lacks formal VERIFICATION.md file.

**Evidence of completion:**
- assessment-specialist.md exists and is substantive
- strategy-specialist.md exists and is substantive
- docs/protocols/specialist-coordination.md exists (867 lines)
- templates/deliverables/ has both templates
- INSTRUCTIONS.md references specialists

**Impact:** Documentation gap only. Phase work is complete.

**Resolution:** Create 05-VERIFICATION.md or accept as documentation debt.

### Phase 7: Video Tutorials Placeholder

**Severity:** LOW

**Details:** README.md line 61 contains "coming soon" for video tutorials link.

**Context:** Video scripts exist in VIDEO_SCRIPTS/ but videos haven't been recorded yet.

**Impact:** Expected — videos depend on human recording from scripts.

**Resolution:** Replace placeholder after recording videos.

---

## Enhancement Opportunities

These are non-blocking improvements identified during audit:

1. **Domain playbooks** — docs/domain/ is empty (by design for user contribution)
2. **CORRECTIONS.md** — ops/voice/CORRECTIONS.md not pre-created (created on-demand)
3. **Example integration** — example/ could show a configured integration state

---

## Summary

**Milestone v1 is COMPLETE.**

- All 42 requirements satisfied
- All 8 phases completed
- Strong cross-phase integration (98/100)
- Complete E2E flows verified
- Minor tech debt (missing verification file, video placeholder)

The system delivers its core value: **Non-technical PMs can operate a powerful AI project management system without understanding git, command line, or code.**

**Recommendation:** Proceed with `/gsd:complete-milestone v1`
