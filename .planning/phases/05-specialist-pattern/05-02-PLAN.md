<objective>
Create strategy specialist and integrate specialist system into INSTRUCTIONS.md.

Purpose: Complete the specialist pair (assessment + strategy) and make specialists discoverable and invokable through the main agent instructions. Users will be able to delegate strategic planning work and find available specialists.

Output: Fully functional strategy-specialist.md plus INSTRUCTIONS.md updated with specialist documentation.

  <name>Task 1: Create strategy-specialist.md and template</name>
  <files>
    .claude/agents/strategy-specialist.md
    templates/deliverables/STRATEGY_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md
  </files>
  <action>
Create the strategy specialist following the pattern established in assessment-specialist.md:

**YAML Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
name: strategy-specialist
description: Domain expert for developing strategies and plans. Use when user asks for strategy development, planning, roadmap creation, or needs forward-looking recommendations. Produces structured STRATEGY_PLAN documents.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Write
model: opus
---
```

Note: Uses `opus` model (not `sonnet`) because strategy requires higher quality reasoning for complex decisions.

**Markdown Body (System Prompt):**

1. **Role definition:** Strategy specialist with expertise in synthesizing findings into actionable strategic plans

2. **Knowledge Loading Protocol:** Same four-layer pattern as assessment-specialist

3. **Prerequisites:** Before developing strategy:
   - Check for existing assessment: entities/[Entity]/deliverables/AUDIT_FINDINGS_*.md
   - If no recent assessment exists, recommend running assessment first
   - If assessment exists, use as input for strategy

4. **Sensitivity Protocol:** Same as assessment-specialist

5. **Deliverable Format:**
   - Save to: entities/[Entity]/deliverables/STRATEGY_PLAN_[DATE].md
   - Use templates/deliverables/STRATEGY_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md as structure guide
   - Pure content only

6. **Workflow:** Same announce -> load -> check -> work -> capture -> summarize pattern

7. **Batch Processing:** Same per-entity update pattern

8. **Knowledge Auto-Capture:** Same pattern

**Also create templates/deliverables/STRATEGY_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md:**

Template structure (from RESEARCH.md):
- Strategy Plan header with entity name
- Generated date and planning horizon placeholders
- Strategic Vision section
- Goals section (Primary + Supporting)
- Strategy section with phases (Phase 1, Phase 2, etc.)
- Resource Requirements section
- Risks and Mitigations table
- Success Metrics section
- Footer with specialist attribution

No metadata/frontmatter - pure content.

  </verify>
  <done>
    - strategy-specialist.md exists with YAML frontmatter
    - Uses opus model for higher quality reasoning
    - Contains prerequisite check for existing assessment
    - Contains same protocols as assessment-specialist
    - STRATEGY_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md exists with full structure
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update INSTRUCTIONS.md with specialist system</name>
  <files>INSTRUCTIONS.md</files>
  <action>
Add a new "Specialists" section to INSTRUCTIONS.md after the "Skills" section. This follows the established pattern of documenting features in INSTRUCTIONS.md with details in docs/protocols/.

**New section to add:**

```markdown
## Specialists

Specialists are domain expert AI personas that produce structured deliverables. Unlike skills (which are procedures), specialists have expertise and judgment for complex work.

**Discovery:** User asks "What specialists do you have?" or `/specialists` -> Show available experts.

**Invocation:** Natural language and explicit naming both work:
- "Run an assessment for Acme" (natural language)
- "Use assessment-specialist for Acme" (explicit)
- "Develop strategy for Beta Corp" (natural language)

**Batch operations:** "Run assessment for all clients" works as one request.

**Available Specialists:**
- assessment-specialist - Conducts audits, gap analyses, current state evaluations
- strategy-specialist - Develops strategic plans, roadmaps, forward-looking recommendations

**Knowledge Layers:** Specialists access layered knowledge:
1. Base PM (INSTRUCTIONS.md, protocols)
2. Domain (docs/domain/ playbooks)
3. Agency (ops/ preferences and processes)
4. Entity (entities/[Entity]/knowledge/ learned context)

**Deliverables:** Specialists save work to `entities/[Entity]/deliverables/` with date-suffix naming (e.g., AUDIT_FINDINGS_2026-01-25.md).

**Sensitivity:** Internal content (INTERNAL_*.md, internal/ folders, <!-- INTERNAL --> markers) is never included in client-facing deliverables.

Specialists are stored in `.claude/agents/` (project) and `~/.claude/agents/` (personal).

See `docs/protocols/specialist-coordination.md` for detailed protocol.
```

Place this section AFTER the "Skills" section and BEFORE the "Code Style" section.

    grep -A 30 "## Specialists" INSTRUCTIONS.md

  <done>
    - INSTRUCTIONS.md contains "## Specialists" section
    - Lists both assessment-specialist and strategy-specialist
    - Documents discovery, invocation, and batch patterns
    - Documents knowledge layers and deliverables
    - References docs/protocols/specialist-coordination.md
