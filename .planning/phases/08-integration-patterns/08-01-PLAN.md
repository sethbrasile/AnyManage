<objective>
Create comprehensive integration documentation explaining MCP from zero-knowledge, the dual source of truth pattern, and graceful degradation.

Purpose: Users need to understand integrations conceptually before using them. This plan establishes foundational documentation that explains what integrations are, why they're optional, and how they work - all without technical jargon.

Output:
- docs/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md - comprehensive guide explaining MCP from scratch, dual source of truth, graceful degradation
- INTEGRATIONS.md - user-facing status file showing available integrations
</objective>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create docs/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md</name>
  <files>docs/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md</files>
  <action>
Create comprehensive integration documentation following the zero-MCP-knowledge approach from CONTEXT.md.

Structure:

1. **What Are Integrations?** (plain language, no jargon)
   - "Connect your AI assistant to other tools you already use"
   - Completely optional - system works fully without them
   - Example scenarios: "See Trello tasks right here", "Sync status automatically"

2. **How They Work** (conceptual, not technical)
   - Your assistant connects to external tools
   - The connection happens automatically - you provide credentials
   - Never mention: MCP, JSON, config files, environment variables

3. **The Dual Source of Truth Pattern**
   - External tool = where you track status (Trello: done/blocked/active)
   - Local repo = where context lives (notes, history, details)
   - Why this works: Best of both worlds
   - Table showing what goes where:
     | External Tool | Local Files |
     |---------------|-------------|
     | Task status | Task context/notes |
     | Due dates | Background info |
     | Assignments | Related files |
     | Quick comments | Full history |

4. **When Things Go Wrong** (graceful degradation)
   - "Integration unavailable" - what it means, what to do
   - System continues working with local data
   - Automatic reconnection and sync prompt
   - No data loss - everything is in your local files too

5. **Available Integrations**
   - Trello (reference implementation)
   - Note: More coming - Calendar, CRM, etc.
   - Link to add-integration skill for setup

6. **Adding New Integrations**
   - Say "Add Trello integration" - assistant handles the rest
   - What you'll need: account credentials (guided step by step)
   - Link to INTEGRATIONS.md for status

7. **Trusted Sources**
   - List of trusted MCP server sources (for the agent to use):
     - Official MCP Registry (registry.modelcontextprotocol.io)
     - npm verified publishers
     - GitHub repos with 1000+ stars
   - User doesn't need to understand this - it's for transparency

Tone: Conversational, non-technical. Use "you" and "your". Explain WHY not just WHAT.
  </action>
  <verify>File exists with 200+ lines, contains "Dual Source of Truth" section, no mentions of "JSON", "config file", or "environment variable" in user-facing sections</verify>
  <done>User with zero technical knowledge can read and understand how integrations work and why they're valuable</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create INTEGRATIONS.md status file</name>
  <files>INTEGRATIONS.md</files>
  <action>
Create user-facing integration status file in project root. This is what users see to check integration status.

Structure:

1. **Header**
   - Brief explanation: "Your connected tools and their status"

2. **Current Integrations** (table format)
   | Integration | Status | Last Sync | Notes |
   |-------------|--------|-----------|-------|
   | Trello | Not configured | - | [Set up Trello](#trello-setup) |

3. **Quick Commands**
   - "Add Trello integration" - start Trello setup
   - "Check integrations" - refresh this status
   - "Sync [integration]" - manual sync trigger

4. **Trello Setup** (anchor link target)
   - Brief: "Say 'Add Trello integration' to get started"
   - What you'll need: Trello account
   - Time: ~5 minutes

5. **Learn More**
   - Link to docs/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md for detailed information
   - Link to ops/TASK_SYNC_PLAYBOOK.md for sync operations (future)

6. **Adding More Integrations**
   - "Say 'Add integration' to see available options"
   - Coming soon: Calendar, CRM integrations

Tone: Brief, scannable. This is a status dashboard, not documentation.
  </action>
  <verify>File exists in project root, has table format for integrations, links to docs/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md</verify>
  <done>Users can quickly check integration status and know how to set up new integrations</done>
</task>
