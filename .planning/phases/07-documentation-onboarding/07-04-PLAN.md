<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create intro/demo video script</name>
  <files>VIDEO_SCRIPTS/01-intro-demo.md</files>
  <action>
Create VIDEO_SCRIPTS/ directory and intro/demo script:

**01-intro-demo.md:**

Target length: 3-4 minutes
Purpose: Overview of what Agent PM is, quick demo, set expectations for series

**Metadata:**
- Video title: "Agent PM: AI Project Management for Non-Technical Users"
- Target length: 3-4 minutes
- Audience: Non-technical PMs curious about AI tools
- Tone: Seth's voice (see .planning/my_voice_example/seth_voice_profile.md)

**Script structure:**

1. **Hook (15 seconds)**
   - What if you could manage clients by just... talking to your computer?
   - Show: Terminal with AI response

2. **What This Is (30 seconds)**
   - Agent PM is a system that lets you manage projects using natural language
   - You talk to it, it handles the files, git, all the technical stuff
   - No coding required

3. **Quick Demo (90 seconds)**
   - "Let me show you what I mean"
   - Add a client: "Add new client Acme Corp"
   - Show result
   - Process notes: "Process notes for Acme"
   - Show extracted tasks
   - Get status: "Show me Acme's status"
   - Show output

4. **What's Coming (30 seconds)**
   - In this series:
     - Full setup walkthrough (link to next video)
     - Feature deep dives (processing notes, specialists, voice training)
   - Everything you need to go from zero to running

5. **Where to Start (15 seconds)**
   - Link to setup video
   - Link to docs
   - Brief closing (Seth style - no drawn out "thank you for watching")

**A/V Format:**
Use two-column table:
| VISUAL | AUDIO |
|--------|-------|
| SHOW: what's on screen | "What Seth says" |

**Production notes** after each section:
- Pause duration
- Zoom instructions
- Font size reminders

**Voice requirements:**
- Use contractions naturally (you'll, don't, it's)
- Include at least one parenthetical aside
- No "I hope this video finds you well" style formality
- Can use "lol" if something is genuinely funny/absurd
- Keep energy authentic, not forced enthusiasm
- Brief, direct closing - not "Thank you so much for watching, please like and subscribe"

6. Quick close (15 seconds)
   - Wrap series
   - Links to docs
   - Brief sign-off

Both scripts:
- Full A/V format
- Production notes
- Seth's voice (check profile)
- YouTube description text
- Timestamps

Voice checklist before finishing each script:
- [ ] No "I hope this video finds you well"
- [ ] Uses contractions (you'll, don't, it's)
- [ ] At least one parenthetical aside per script
- [ ] No "Thank you so much for watching"
- [ ] Direct, helpful, not artificially enthusiastic

<verification>
1. VIDEO_SCRIPTS/ directory exists
2. All 5 scripts present (01 through 05)
3. Each script uses A/V table format
4. Production notes included in each
5. Description text and timestamps included
6. Seth's voice markers present (contractions, parentheticals, no formality)

8. Scripts flow as coherent series
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Seth can record videos using scripts as-is (minimal rewriting needed)
- Scripts sound like Seth wrote them, not AI
- A/V format makes recording straightforward
- Series covers: overview, setup, entities, notes, voice training
- Production notes reduce editing decisions during recording
</success_criteria>
