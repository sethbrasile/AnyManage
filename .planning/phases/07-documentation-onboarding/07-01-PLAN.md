<objective>
Create README.md entry point and foundational user documentation.

Purpose: README.md is the critical missing piece - users currently have no entry point. This plan establishes the single clear first step and foundational guides that all other documentation builds upon.

Output:
- README.md with progressive disclosure structure (quick start first, details after)
- docs/guides/getting-started.md with universal first steps
- docs/guides/customization.md for industry adaptation
- docs/guides/skill-discovery.md for workflow discovery
</objective>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create README.md with progressive disclosure structure</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Create README.md following the progressive disclosure pattern from research. Structure:

1. **Opening** (under 50 words):
   - One-line description: "AI project management for non-technical users"
   - What you'll get in 5 minutes (can add clients, process notes, get status)

2. **Quick Start** (one command):
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url> agent-pm && cd agent-pm && claude
   ```
   Then: Type "Add new client Acme Corp"

3. **What You Can Do** (brief list):
   - Add clients: "Add new client [name]"
   - Process notes: "Process notes for [client]"
   - Get status: "Show me [client]'s status"
   - Run assessments: "Run assessment for [client]"

4. **Next Steps** (links):
   - Detailed setup guide (docs/guides/getting-started.md)
   - Customization (docs/guides/customization.md)
   - Troubleshooting (docs/guides/troubleshooting.md)

5. **How It Works** (brief explanation):
   - File structure + AI instructions = smart assistant
   - Changes tracked automatically (git invisible)

6. **Requirements**:
   - macOS, Windows, or Linux
   - One of: Claude Code, opencode, or codex
   - No technical background required

7. **What's Included**:
   - Ready-to-use system
   - Skill library
   - Specialist agents
   - Optional voice training

8. **Learn More**:
   - Reference example link
   - Video tutorials link (placeholder for now)
   - Customization guide link

Use conversational tone per CONTEXT.md. No "I hope this email finds you well" style formality. Direct, helpful, actionable.

  <files>
docs/guides/getting-started.md
docs/guides/customization.md
docs/guides/skill-discovery.md
  </files>
  <action>
Create three foundational guide files in docs/guides/:

**getting-started.md:**
- Universal first steps (not agent-specific - that comes in Plan 03)
- What the system is and how it works conceptually
- Overview of file structure (entities/, templates/, ops/, docs/)
- What happens when you start a session
- Link to agent-specific tutorials (placeholder for now: "See [Claude Code setup](claude-code-setup.md)")
- First things to try after setup
- Conversational tone: explain WHY things exist, use analogies

**customization.md:**
- How to change entity type (CONFIG.md)
- How to modify templates (ENTITY_PROFILE_TEMPLATE.md, ENTITY_ROADMAP_TEMPLATE.md)
- How to add domain knowledge (docs/domain/)
- How to add agency/team preferences (ops/)
- How to create custom skills (link to SKILL_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md)
- Examples for different industries:
  - Marketing agency (default) -> clients
  - Software team -> projects
  - Healthcare -> patients
  - Consulting -> engagements
- Step-by-step: "To change from clients to projects..."

**skill-discovery.md:**
- What skills are (reusable workflows)
- How to discover them ("What skills do you have?")
- How to invoke them (natural language or slash commands)
- List of built-in skills:
  - process-notes
  - get-status
  - weekly-review
- How to find more skills (docs/SKILL_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md for creating your own)
- Relationship between skills and specialists (skills = procedures, specialists = domain experts)

All guides should use conversational tone, explain the "why", and include examples.

  <done>Three guide files exist with comprehensive content in conversational tone</done>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. README.md exists at project root with quick start in first 50 words
2. docs/guides/ contains getting-started.md, customization.md, skill-discovery.md
3. All files use conversational tone (no "Additionally," "Furthermore," "Moreover")
4. README.md links to docs/guides/ files
5. No broken internal links
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- User visiting repo sees README.md with one clear first step
- User can understand what system does within 30 seconds of reading
- User can clone and start within 2 minutes following README
- Guides explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Tone is conversational, not corporate documentation
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/07-documentation-onboarding/07-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
