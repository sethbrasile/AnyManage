  <action>
Create example/ directory with the reference marketing agency:

**example/README.md:**
- Title: "Reference Example: Digital Marketing Agency"
- What this example demonstrates
- The three clients and what stage each represents:
  1. **Sunrise Digital** - Just onboarded (minimal state)
     - Shows what system looks like right after "Add new client Sunrise Digital"
     - Empty profile sections, clean roadmap
  2. **Bright Path Consulting** - Notes processed
     - Shows what happens after processing meeting notes
     - Profile has extracted facts, roadmap has tasks
  3. **Metro Events Co** - Full workflow complete
     - Shows specialist deliverables
     - Has assessment findings and strategy document
- How to explore the example (suggested order)
- How this maps to your own usage

**example/CONFIG.md:**
- Entity type: "client" / "clients"
- Note: "This is a reference example. Clone the main repo to create your own."

**example/ROADMAP.md:**
- Master dashboard showing all three clients
- Priority sections (High/Medium/Low)
- Status checkboxes showing different stages
- Realistic project items for each client

Use realistic marketing agency context - these should feel like real clients with real projects.
