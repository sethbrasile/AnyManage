<objective>
Create agent-specific setup tutorials and troubleshooting documentation.

Purpose: Non-technical users need step-by-step guidance for their specific agent platform. The troubleshooting guide (plus matching skill) ensures users can resolve issues without external help, satisfying the standalone operation requirement.

Output:
- Agent-specific tutorials (Claude Code, opencode, codex) with keystroke-level detail
- Troubleshooting guide in FAQ format with escalation paths
- Troubleshooting skill so agent can help diagnose issues

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Claude Code setup tutorial</name>
  <files>docs/guides/claude-code-setup.md</files>
  <action>
Create comprehensive Claude Code setup tutorial assuming ZERO terminal experience:

**Structure:**
1. **Before You Start**
   - What you need: macOS, Windows, or Linux
   - Claude Code installation link (https://claude.ai/code or equivalent)
   - Terminal experience required: none (we'll show every step)
   - Note: Using different agent? Links to opencode/codex tutorials

2. **Step 1: Open Your Terminal**
   - macOS: "Press Cmd+Space, type 'Terminal', press Enter"
   - Windows: "Press Windows key, type 'Command Prompt', press Enter"
   - Linux: "Press Ctrl+Alt+T"
   - Include: What you'll see (prompt like `user@computer ~ %`)
   - Explain: This is where you type commands to the computer

3. **Step 2: Clone Agent PM**
   - Full command with explanation
   - What "clone" means (downloading a copy of the project)
   - What you'll see while it runs
   - How to know when it's done (prompt returns)

4. **Step 3: Enter the Project**
   - `cd agent-pm` command
   - What `cd` means (change directory - like opening a folder)
   - How to verify you're in the right place

5. **Step 4: Start Claude Code**
   - `claude` command
   - What happens (loading instructions, checking files)
   - What the ready state looks like

6. **Step 5: Your First Command**
   - `Add new client Acme Corp`
   - What happens (folder created, confirmation message)
   - What the AI suggests next

7. **Next Steps**
   - Try more commands (list 3-4)
   - Link to common workflows
   - Link to troubleshooting

**Tone:** Conversational, explain WHY at each step. Use analogies ("Think of the terminal like a text-based file browser"). Celebrate small wins ("Nice! You just created your first client.").

**Critical:** Include what success looks like at each step. User should never be wondering "did that work?"
  </action>
  <verify>wc -l docs/guides/claude-code-setup.md shows 100+ lines; grep -c "Step" docs/guides/claude-code-setup.md shows multiple steps</verify>
  <done>Claude Code tutorial exists with keystroke-level detail and conversational tone</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create opencode and codex setup tutorials</name>
  <files>
docs/guides/opencode-setup.md
docs/guides/codex-setup.md
  </files>
  <action>
Create setup tutorials for opencode and codex following same pattern as Claude Code:

**opencode-setup.md:**
- Same basic structure as Claude Code tutorial
- Installation: npm/pip install instructions
- Different startup command (if applicable)
- Note any capability differences from Claude Code
- Highlight: "opencode is open source and free"
- Same conversational tone and step-by-step detail
- Note known limitations: "opencode doesn't support X, so you'll need to Y"

**codex-setup.md:**
- Same basic structure
- OpenAI codex installation/setup
- Different startup command (if applicable)
- Note capability differences
- Same conversational tone
- Note known limitations

Both tutorials should:
- Assume zero terminal experience
- Explain every command
- Show what success looks like at each step
- Link to troubleshooting
- Cross-reference: "Using Claude Code instead? See [Claude Code setup](claude-code-setup.md)"

Note: If specific installation details are unknown, use reasonable placeholders with notes like "[Check opencode.ai for current installation instructions]" - the priority is the structure and tone being correct.
  </action>
  <verify>ls -la docs/guides/*.md shows both files exist; wc -l docs/guides/opencode-setup.md docs/guides/codex-setup.md shows reasonable length</verify>
  <done>Both alternative agent tutorials exist with consistent structure and tone</done>
</task>

  <name>Task 3: Create troubleshooting guide and skill</name>
  <files>
docs/guides/troubleshooting.md
.github/skills/troubleshoot/SKILL.md
  </files>
  <action>
Create FAQ-format troubleshooting guide and matching agent skill:

**docs/guides/troubleshooting.md:**

Structure by category:
1. **Installation Issues**
   - "Command not found: claude" (or opencode/codex)
   - "Permission denied"
   - "git: command not found"
   - "Repository not found"

2. **Startup Issues**
   - "Agent doesn't load INSTRUCTIONS.md"
   - "STATE.md not found" warning
   - "Session doesn't remember previous work"
   - Agent seems to ignore instructions

3. **Entity Management Issues**
   - "Entity folder wasn't created"
   - "Profile didn't update"
   - "Notes didn't process correctly"
   - Duplicate entity created

4. **Skill/Specialist Issues**
   - "Skill not found"
   - Specialist doesn't produce deliverable
   - "What specialists do you have?" shows nothing

5. **Voice Training Issues**
   - Can't find voice profile
   - Voice not being applied
   - Training didn't work as expected

Each issue follows format:
```markdown
### "[Error message or symptom]"

**What this means:** Plain English explanation

**How to fix:**
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Verification step

**Still stuck?** [Open an issue](https://github.com/<repo>/issues)
```

Include escalation path to GitHub issues for unresolved problems.

**.github/skills/troubleshoot/SKILL.md:**

Create skill that:
- Declares troubleshooting capability
- References docs/guides/troubleshooting.md as knowledge base
- Can diagnose issues based on user descriptions
- Guides user through resolution steps
- Knows when to suggest opening GitHub issue

Skill pattern:
- Trigger: "help", "something's wrong", "not working", error descriptions
- Action: Diagnose based on symptoms, walk through relevant troubleshooting steps
- Uses troubleshooting.md as single source of truth (doesn't duplicate content)
  </action>
  <verify>grep -c "###" docs/guides/troubleshooting.md shows multiple FAQ entries; cat .github/skills/troubleshoot/SKILL.md shows skill structure</verify>
  <done>Troubleshooting guide with 15+ FAQ entries and matching skill for agent-assisted diagnosis</done>
</task>
