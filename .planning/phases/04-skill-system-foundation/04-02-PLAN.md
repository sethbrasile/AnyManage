<objective>
Create the three PM base skills: process-notes, get-status, and weekly-review. These skills encode best practices for common PM workflows and reference existing protocols.

Purpose: Provide reusable workflows that users can invoke naturally. These skills form the foundation of the skill system and demonstrate the SKILL.md format for Plan 04-03's authoring guide.

Output: Three SKILL.md files in .github/skills/ following Agent Skills 1.0 standard

# Process Notes Skill

Extract tasks, profile facts, calendar items, and follow-ups from meeting notes and unstructured text.

## When to Use

- User says "process notes for [entity]"
- User mentions extracting tasks from notes
- User wants to update entity profile from meeting notes
- User provides notes inline, references files, or uses top-level NOTES.md

## How It Works

See `docs/protocols/note-processing.md` for the complete step-by-step protocol.

**Summary:**
1. Identify input source (pasted content, entity notes/ folder, or NOTES.md)
2. Extract tasks, profile facts, calendar items, follow-ups
3. Apply updates to entity's ROADMAP.md and PROFILE.md
4. Archive processed notes with timestamp header
5. Report itemized results

## Batch Processing

Supports:
- "Process notes for Acme, Beta, Gamma" -> specific entities
- "Process notes for all clients" -> all entities
- "Process notes for Acme" -> single entity

Shows progress: "Processing 3 entities... (1/3 complete)"

## Output Format

```
Processed notes for [Entity Name]:

- Tasks added to roadmap (3):
  - [ ] Follow up on budget proposal (by Friday)
  - [ ] Schedule quarterly review
  - [ ] Send revised timeline

- Profile updated:
  - Added to Key Contacts: Sarah Chen (CFO)
  - Added to Business Goals: Expand to 3 new markets

- Notes archived to: entities/[Name]/notes/archive/[filename].md
```

## Error Handling

- Entity not found -> Offer to create entity first
- No notes found -> Ask user to paste or add file
- Ambiguous content -> Discussion mode (ask for clarification)
```

Create the directory `.github/skills/process-notes/` if it doesn't exist.

Key points:
- Description includes triggering language for LLM matching
- References existing protocol (no duplication)
- Supports batch operations with progress feedback
- Entity-type aware via metadata

---
name: get-status
description: Show current status of an entity or all entities. Use when the user asks "what's the status", "show me updates", "how is [entity] doing", or wants to see progress for clients/projects.

# Get Status Skill

Display current state of entities: active tasks, recent updates, next steps.

## When to Use

- "What's the status of Acme?"
- "Show me updates for Beta Industries"
- "What's happening with all my clients?"
- "How is [entity] doing?"

## How It Works

1. Read entity's ENTITY_ROADMAP.md
2. Extract active tasks (`[ ]`), in-progress items (`[-]`), completed items (`[x]`)
3. Read entity's ENTITY_PROFILE.md for last update timestamp
4. Format summary for user

## Output Format (Single Entity)

```
Status: Acme Corp

Active Work (3 tasks):
- [ ] Follow up on budget proposal (by Friday)
- [-] Security audit in progress (started 01/20)
- [ ] Schedule quarterly review

Recently Completed:
- [x] Send revised timeline (01/22)

Last Profile Update: 2026-01-24
Next Steps: Follow up on budget by Friday
```

## Output Format (All Entities)

```
Status Across All Entities (12 total):

High Activity:
- Acme Corp: 5 active tasks, 2 in progress
- Beta Industries: 3 active tasks, 1 needs attention (deadline Friday)

On Track:
- Gamma LLC: 2 active tasks
- Delta Partners: 1 active task

Quiet:
- Epsilon Group: No active tasks (last update 01/15)
```

## Batch Processing

- "Get status for Acme, Beta" -> specific entities
- "Get status for all clients" -> all entities
- "Get status" (no entity specified) -> ask user or default to all

## Error Handling

- Entity not found -> List available entities, ask which one
- No roadmap found -> Report entity exists but has no roadmap
```

---
name: weekly-review
description: Generate weekly status report across all entities. Use when the user asks for a "weekly review", "weekly summary", "status update across all clients", or wants to see progress across entities. Automatically runs for all entities unless specific ones are mentioned.

# Weekly Review Skill

Generate comprehensive weekly status report showing progress across all entities.

## When to Use

- "Run weekly review"
- "Show me this week's progress"
- "What got done across all my clients?"
- "Weekly summary"
- End of week status check

## How It Works

1. Read all entity ENTITY_ROADMAP.md files
2. Extract tasks completed this week (checkbox `[x]` with date in past 7 days)
3. Extract tasks still in progress (`[-]`)
4. Identify entities needing attention (overdue tasks, no updates in 7+ days)
5. Generate aggregated summary + per-entity breakdown

## Output Format

```
Weekly Review: Jan 18-24, 2026

Summary:
- Total entities: 12
- Active tasks: 47
- Completed this week: 23
- Entities needing attention: 3 (Beta Industries, Zeta Corp, Epsilon Group)

Completed This Week (23 tasks):

[Acme Corp]
- [x] Send revised budget proposal (01/22)
- [x] Schedule Q2 kickoff meeting (01/23)

[Beta Industries]
- [x] Complete security audit (01/20)
- [x] Submit compliance documentation (01/24)

[... more entities ...]

In Progress (12 tasks):

[Acme Corp]
- [-] Security audit in progress (started 01/20)

[... more entities ...]

Needs Attention:
- [Beta Industries] Overdue: Follow up on proposal (due 01/23)
- [Zeta Corp] No updates in 10 days (last: 01/14)
- [Epsilon Group] 3 tasks pending, no progress this week

Next Week Priorities:
- Follow up on overdue items (Beta, Epsilon)
- Check in with Zeta (no recent updates)
- Continue in-progress work (Acme security audit)
```

## Customization

User can request:
- "Weekly review for high-priority clients only" -> filter by priority section
- "Weekly review for Acme and Beta" -> specific entities
- "Weekly review showing only completed items" -> filter output

## Date Detection

- Look for dates in task text: "(01/22)", "(by Friday)", "(due Jan 24)"
- If no date in task, use file modification time as fallback
- "This week" = past 7 days from current date

## Error Handling

- No entities exist -> Report "No entities found. Create some first with 'Add new client [Name]'"
- No completed tasks this week -> Report "No tasks completed this week. Here's what's in progress..."
