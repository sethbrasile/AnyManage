<objective>
Create the core document templates that users copy when creating new entities.

Purpose: Provide ready-to-use templates with clear placeholders so users can quickly create consistent entity profiles and roadmaps. Templates encode the structure and best practices without requiring users to think about formatting.

Output:
- ENTITY_PROFILE_TEMPLATE.md - comprehensive profile template
- ENTITY_ROADMAP_TEMPLATE.md - task tracking roadmap template
</objective>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create ENTITY_PROFILE_TEMPLATE.md</name>
  <files>templates/ENTITY_PROFILE_TEMPLATE.md</files>
  <action>
Create a comprehensive entity profile template in templates/ folder.

**Structure requirements:**

1. **Header** - Title with `[Entity Name]` placeholder

2. **Entity Information** section:
   - Legal Name
   - Industry/Vertical
   - Size (employees, revenue range)
   - Founded year
   - Location/Headquarters
   - Website
   - Primary business description

3. **Key Contacts** section:
   - Table format with columns: Name, Role, Email, Notes
   - Include 2-3 placeholder rows

4. **Business Goals** section:
   - Annual/quarterly goals with target metrics
   - 3-5 placeholder goal items

5. **Our Relationship** section:
   - How we work together
   - Services we provide
   - Start date of engagement
   - Billing/contract notes

6. **Communication Preferences** section:
   - Preferred channels
   - Meeting cadence
   - Key dates/deadlines

7. **Notes** section:
   - Free-form area for additional context

**Template design principles (from research):**
- Use `[Placeholder Text]` format - visually obvious what to replace
- Group related information in clear sections
- Use markdown tables for structured data (contacts, etc.)
- Keep sections focused but comprehensive
- Works standalone without requiring other files

Do NOT use complex frontmatter - keep it simple for non-technical users.
Use plain English headers (not technical jargon).

Run: `cat /Users/seth/Documents/GitHub/agent-pm/templates/ENTITY_PROFILE_TEMPLATE.md`
Verify: File has [Entity Name] placeholder in title
Verify: File has Key Contacts table with placeholder rows
Verify: File has Business Goals section with placeholder items
Count: File should be 50+ lines for comprehensive coverage
  </verify>
  <done>ENTITY_PROFILE_TEMPLATE.md exists with all required sections, clear placeholders, and user-friendly structure</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create ENTITY_ROADMAP_TEMPLATE.md</name>
  <files>templates/ENTITY_ROADMAP_TEMPLATE.md</files>
  <action>
Create an entity-specific roadmap template for tracking work with a single entity.

**Structure requirements:**

1. **Header** - Title with `[Entity Name]` placeholder and brief description

2. **Progress Tracking Convention** - Same as master ROADMAP.md:
   - `[ ]` = Todo
   - `[-]` = In Progress (add date when started)
   - `[x]` = Completed (add date when finished)

3. **Current Phase** section:
   - What we're working on now
   - Key milestones for this phase
   - Checkbox tasks for current work

4. **Upcoming Work** section:
   - Next phases/projects planned
   - Checkbox items for future tasks

5. **Completed Work** section:
   - Archive of finished work
   - Includes completion dates and brief outcomes

6. **Key Milestones** section:
   - Important dates and deliverables
   - Table format: Date | Milestone | Status

7. **Notes** section:
   - Free-form area for additional context

**Checkbox syntax (exact):**
- `- [ ]` for todo (space after dash, space in brackets)
- `- [-]` for in-progress
- `- [x]` for completed

Include example placeholder tasks showing the format:
```
- [ ] [Task description]
- [-] [In-progress task] - Started YYYY-MM-DD
- [x] [Completed task] - Done YYYY-MM-DD
```

Template should be shorter than profile (40+ lines) - roadmaps grow over time.
  </action>

Run: `cat /Users/seth/Documents/GitHub/agent-pm/templates/ENTITY_ROADMAP_TEMPLATE.md`
Verify: File has [Entity Name] placeholder in title
Verify: File has checkbox convention section matching master ROADMAP.md
Verify: File has example checkboxes in correct format: `- [ ]`
Count: File should be 40+ lines
  </verify>
  <done>ENTITY_ROADMAP_TEMPLATE.md exists with checkbox tracking, phase sections, and milestone table</done>

After all tasks complete:

1. Template existence check:
```bash
ls -la /Users/seth/Documents/GitHub/agent-pm/templates/
# Should show: ENTITY_PROFILE_TEMPLATE.md, ENTITY_ROADMAP_TEMPLATE.md, .gitkeep
```

2. Placeholder format check:
```bash
grep -c "\[.*\]" /Users/seth/Documents/GitHub/agent-pm/templates/ENTITY_PROFILE_TEMPLATE.md
# Should show multiple placeholder matches
```

3. Checkbox syntax check:
```bash
grep -E "^\- \[[ x\-]\]" /Users/seth/Documents/GitHub/agent-pm/templates/ENTITY_ROADMAP_TEMPLATE.md
# Should show checkbox examples
```

4. Template usability test: A non-technical user should be able to:
   - Copy template to entity folder
   - See exactly what to fill in (placeholders are obvious)
   - Complete the document without consulting documentation
