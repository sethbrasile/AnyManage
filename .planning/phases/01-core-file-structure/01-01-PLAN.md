<objective>
Create the foundational folder structure and core configuration files for the Agent PM system.

Purpose: Establish the semantic folder hierarchy that organizes all project data, plus the master dashboard and configuration that tie everything together. This is the skeleton on which all future phases build.

Output:
- Project root with entities/, templates/, ops/ folders
- CONFIG.md with entity type configuration
- ROADMAP.md master dashboard with checkbox status tracking

  <name>Task 1: Create semantic folder structure</name>
  <files>
    entities/.gitkeep
    templates/.gitkeep
    ops/.gitkeep
  </files>
  <action>
Create three core directories at project root with .gitkeep files to ensure they persist in git even when empty:

1. **entities/** - Where all managed entities live (clients, projects, products - whatever entity type user configures)
2. **templates/** - Reusable document templates (profile, roadmap, etc.)
3. **ops/** - Agency/team operations (team profiles, processes)

Each folder gets a .gitkeep file containing a brief description of the folder's purpose. Format:
```
# [Folder Name]

[One-sentence description of what goes here]

This file ensures the folder exists in git even when empty.
```

Do NOT create nested subfolders yet - entity subfolders are created when entities are added.
Do NOT create .planning/ folder - it already exists from project setup.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `ls -la /Users/seth/Documents/GitHub/agent-pm/` - should show entities/, templates/, ops/ directories
Run: `cat /Users/seth/Documents/GitHub/agent-pm/entities/.gitkeep` - should show folder description
  </verify>
  <done>Three semantic folders exist at project root with descriptive .gitkeep files</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create CONFIG.md with entity type configuration</name>
  <files>CONFIG.md</files>
  <action>
Create CONFIG.md at project root with:

1. **YAML frontmatter** containing machine-readable configuration:
   - entity_type: client (default - user can customize)
   - entity_type_plural: clients
   - entity_profile_doc: ENTITY_PROFILE
   - entity_roadmap_doc: ENTITY_ROADMAP

2. **Body content** explaining:
   - What this system manages (the entity type)
   - How to customize the entity type for different use cases
   - Current folder structure overview
   - Document naming conventions

Use plain English suitable for non-technical users. Include examples of other entity types (projects, products, customers) to show configurability.

Reference research pattern from 01-RESEARCH.md "Minimal Configuration File" section.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `cat /Users/seth/Documents/GitHub/agent-pm/CONFIG.md` - should show frontmatter with entity_type and human-readable explanation
Verify frontmatter is valid YAML (has opening and closing ---)
  </verify>
  <done>CONFIG.md exists with entity type configuration in frontmatter and clear human-readable explanation in body</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create ROADMAP.md master dashboard</name>
  <files>ROADMAP.md</files>
  <action>
Create ROADMAP.md at project root as the master dashboard showing all entities with checkbox status tracking.

Required sections:

1. **Header** with project title and brief description

2. **Progress Tracking Convention** - Document the checkbox syntax:
   - `[ ]` = Todo
   - `[-]` = In Progress (add date when started)
   - `[x]` = Completed (add date when finished)

3. **Active Entities** section with priority groupings:
   - High Priority
   - Medium Priority
   - Low Priority

   Include placeholder examples in comments showing the format:
   `- [-] [Entity Name] - Current phase/task - YYYY-MM-DD`

4. **Recently Completed** section for finished work

5. **Quick Links** section pointing to:
   - CONFIG.md
   - templates/ folder

Use exact checkbox syntax from research: `- [ ]`, `- [-]`, `- [x]` (note the spaces).
Include the checkmark emoji convention for completed items.
Make it clear this is where all entity status is tracked at a glance.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `cat /Users/seth/Documents/GitHub/agent-pm/ROADMAP.md` - should show checkbox sections
Verify checkbox syntax is exactly: `- [ ]` (with spaces)
  </verify>
  <done>ROADMAP.md exists as master dashboard with checkbox status tracking, priority sections, and example format</done>
</task>

After all tasks complete:

1. Folder structure check:
```bash
ls -la /Users/seth/Documents/GitHub/agent-pm/
# Should show: entities/, templates/, ops/, CONFIG.md, ROADMAP.md, .planning/
```

2. File content spot check:
```bash
head -20 /Users/seth/Documents/GitHub/agent-pm/CONFIG.md
head -30 /Users/seth/Documents/GitHub/agent-pm/ROADMAP.md
```

3. Semantic clarity test: A non-technical user looking at the folder list should immediately understand:
   - entities/ = where my clients/projects live
   - templates/ = reusable document templates
   - ops/ = team operations stuff
   - CONFIG.md = system configuration
   - ROADMAP.md = dashboard of all work
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] entities/ folder exists with descriptive .gitkeep
- [ ] templates/ folder exists with descriptive .gitkeep
- [ ] ops/ folder exists with descriptive .gitkeep
- [ ] CONFIG.md exists with entity_type frontmatter and human-readable explanation
- [ ] ROADMAP.md exists with checkbox tracking convention and priority sections
- [ ] All folder names are self-documenting (no jargon, no abbreviations)
- [ ] Non-technical user could navigate structure without reading documentation

After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-core-file-structure/01-01-SUMMARY.md`
